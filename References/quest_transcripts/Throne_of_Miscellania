Throne of Miscellania (Nov 7, 2008)
Sources: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNa8qCmeb-Q

Start quest by talking to King Vargas in Miscellania.

King Vargas: "Who are you? Who seeks audience with the King of this fair land of Miscellania?"
Player: "I am known in these lands as <fremennikname>, Your Majesty. I come in search of a quest."
King Vargas: "Ah, it pleases me to see such enthusiasm!"
King Vargas: "I was once an adventurer such as yourself; even while fulfilling my duties as King of Miscellania, I would roam the lands in search of adventure, and strike down mighty foes with a single blow!"
King Vargas: "Unfortunately, I was a little too daring, and attempted to brave the icelands, where I finally met my match."
King Vargas: "I survived, barely, but I was cursed for the rest of my life to stay in this form. Which leaves me incapable of performing my duties as ruler."
King Vargas: "This is why I am looking for an exceptional soul to be regent of this fair kingdom of Miscellania."

Select an Option
	"If I may be so bold..."
		Player: "If I may be so bold, Your Majesty, I think Miscellania would rest in capable hands with me."
		King Vargas: "Hahaha! You are bold, <fremennikname>, but then I have yet to see a good ruler who was not."
		King Vargas: "You will first have to demonstrate your worth. You are a good warrior, that I do not doubt; however ruling also requires a good grasp of diplomacy."
		King Vargas: "We have been at war with neighbouring Etceteria for hundreds of years; however, I think both of us have rather lost our apetite for hostilities."
		King Vargas: "Now may be an opportune time to make amends. If you manage to negotiate peace with them, then you will truly have shown your skill as a diplomat."
		Player: "Then do not stray far, Your Majesty, for I shall soon return."
		King Vargas: "Wait! There is one more matter to discuss... a mere formality, of course."
		King Vargas: "By Miscellanious tradition, one may not become the ruler of the kingdom if one is not part of the royal family."
		King Vargas: "You will have to convince my <son/daughter>, <Prince Bland/Princess Astrid>, to marry you."
		Player: "And you say this is a mere formality, Your Majesty?"
		King Vargas: "I'm sure <he/she> won't be able to resist your heroic charms. You can ask Ghrim for advice; that's what he's here for, after all."
		<end of dialogue, quest progresses>
		
	"I'm afraid I must decline."
	
Talk to Advisor Ghrim.

Advisor Ghrim: "Greetings <Madam/Sir>."

Select an Option
	"What am I meant to be doing again?"
	"How do I make peace with Etceteria?"
		Player: "How do I make peace with Etceteria?"
		Advisor Ghrim: "You should go talk to Queen Sigrid of Etceteria."
		<end dialogue>
	"How am I supposed to get the <Prince/Princess> to marry me?"
	"Is there anything else you can tell me?"
	
Go talk to Queen Sigrid in Etceteria.

Queen Sigrid: "Hello."
Player: "Er... Hello, Your Majesty."
Queen Sigrid: Have you come for a particular reason? I am a busy Queen, you know. I had to attend the opening of a new orphanage this morning."
Player: "Yes, I..."
Queen Sigrid: "And this afternoon, I shall be receiving the Embassador of Karamja and accompanying him on this week-long tour of Etceteria."
Player: "Er, I..."
Queen Sigrid: "Then this evening we shall be putting on a grand ball. All of the kingdom's nobility will be present!"
Player: "If I m..."
Queen Sigrid: "Oh, who am I kidding...nothing ever happens here. I always wanted to be a princess when I was a girl. If I'd been told it would be like this, I wouldn't have bothered."
Player: "Your Majesty!"
Queen Sigrid: "Yes? Did you want something?"
Player: "I have been sent by King Vargas to negotiate a treaty of peace between your two great nations."
Queen Sigrid: "Great nations? Don't make me laugh. Still, peace sounds like a nice idea. He will, of course, have to recognise Etceteria officially as a sovereign nation."
Player: "This isn't already the case?"
Queen Sigrid: "I'm afraid not. Last time we met I called him a pompous old fool for thinking he was still worth anything as an adventurer."
Queen Sigrid: "He promptly declared war, claiming the land of Etceteria belonged to Miscellania."
Queen Sigrid: "When he realized neither of us had an army, he was ever so angry!"
Player: "What happened then?"
Queen Sigrid: "He set off for the icelands to prove me wrong and, well, I expect you saw what happened to him."
Player: "I shall go ask him to officially recognise Etceteria."
<end of dialogue, quest progresses>

Go talk to King Vargas.

Player: "Your Majesty."
King Vargas: "How are you getting on, <fremennikname>? Have you tried talking to Queen Sigrid of Etceteria?"
Player: "I have, Your Majesty. She says she will agree to peace as long as Miscellania recognises Etceteria as a sovereign nation."
King Vargas: "Hmph! You can tell her I'll officially recognise her country as soon as she changes the Etceteria national anthem."
Player: "Why is that, Your Majesty?"
King Vargas: "It's insulting! The title alone, "You're Stupid, We're the Best", should be enough to give you an idea!"
Player: "I'm sure I can convince her there are better anthems."
<end of dialogue, quest progresses>

Talk to Queen Sigrid.

Queen Sigrid: "Hello. Have you talked to Vargas yet?"
Player: "I have, Your Majesty. He says he will recognise the country when you change your anthem."
Queen Sigrid: "What? But it's a great anthem, I composed it myself! Listen!"
Queen Sigrid: ""You're stupid, we're the best / Etceteria beats the rest! / and Queen Sigrid is very pretty, / King Vargas is a good, hey, nonny-nonny!""
Player: "I'm afraid he insisted, Your Majesty."
Queen Sigrid: "Well, it can't be helped I suppose..."
Queen Sigrid: "You'll have to find a bard to write a new one though. And there isn't a hard to be had for love nor money in Etceteria."
Player: "I'll see what I can do, Your Majesty."

Go talk to Prince Brand.
Player: "I need someone to compose a new anthem for Etceteria."
Prince Brand: "You've come to the right bard! I'll write one for you immediately!"
Player: "You can take your time, really..."
Prince Brand: "No problem, I'm already done! Here, listen!"
Prince Brand: "'Etceteria, Etceteria, / Oh what a great country it is. / Etceteria, Etceteria, / So I wrote a song about it.'"
Prince Brand: "'It's somewhere in the sea, / And it looks very nice, / If it weren't for your ancestors, / It wouldn't be there at all,'"
Prince Brand: "'And when things aren't going too well, /  We sing this lovely song, / And then we'll all feel so much better, / It won't take very long.'"
Prince Brand: "Here's a copy, you can keep it!"
Player: "... that's lovely, thanks."
Prince Brand: "Don't mention it, <Madam/Sir>."
<end of dialogue, quest progresses.>

Talk to Advisor Ghrim

Advisor Ghrim: "Greetings, <Madam/Sir>."
Player: "I got Prince Brand to compose a new Etceterian Anthem for me, but it's awful.!"
Advisor Ghrim: "Oh dear. Well, that is only to be expected. May I see it, please?"
Player: "Here you go."
Advisor Ghrim: "Hmm, yes...allow me to make a few adjustments."
Advisor Ghrim: "There you go <Madam/Sir>. Are there any other matters in which I may be of assistance?"

Go talk to Queen Sigrid.

Queen Sigrid: "Hello. Have you found a new anthem yet?"
Player: "Yes, Your Majesty."
Queen Sigrid: "Let's see now..."
Queen Sigrid: "'Etceteria, Etceteria, / Of our country are are proud! / Etceteria, Etceteria, / Let all sing its name out loud!'"
Queen Sigrid: "'Rising high above the water, / The jewel of the North!, / Our mothers and our fathers, / To build this land came forth!'"
Queen Sigrid: "'And in the times of darkness, /  Sing praises of our land! / And in our hearts we can be sure, / Our victory is at hand!'"
Queen Sigrid: "Why, this is quite good! I'm surprised!"
Queen Sigrid: "Here is a treaty declaring what we've mutually agreed to. I've already signed, so all it needs is King Vargas' signature and it'll be official."
<end of dialogue, quest progresses>

Talk to King Vargas.

Player: "Your Majesty."
King Vargas: "How are you getting on, <fremennikname>? Have you convinced Sigrid yet?"
Player: "I have here a treaty awaiting your signature."
King Vargas: "I doubt I will be able to hold an ordinary pen well enough to sign the treaty. You will have to find a pen large enough for me to hold."
<end of dialogue, quest progresses>

Talk to Derrik, to the north east in the smithy.

Derrik: Good day, <Madam/Sir>. Can I help you with anything?

Select an Option
	"Can I use your anvil?"
	"I have a slightly strange request..."
		Player: "I have a slightly strange request..."
		Player: "The King needs to sign a treaty, but is unable to because he lacks a pen large enough for him to hold. Could you make me a nib of the right size?"
		Derrik: "Hm... I may be able to manage that. What sort of size?"
		Player: "About the size of a helm should do."
		Derrik: "All right, but I'll need an iron bar to make it from."
		Player: "I have one here." 
		Derrik: "Good. Just a minute..."
		Derrik: "Here you go! One giant pen nib!"
		<end of dialogue, quest progresses.>

Go talk to King Vargas.

Player: "Your Majesty."
King Vargas: "How are you getting on, <fremennikname>? Have you found me a pen yet?"
Player: "Here it is, Your Majesty."
King Vargas: "Excellent! And now, with a flourish, I sign the end of the rivalry between our two proud kingdoms."
King Vargas: "Now, has my <son/daughter> agreed to marry you?"
Player: "Not yet, Your Majesty."	
King Vargas: "Well, keep at it then!"
King Vargas: "Ghrim tells me that the population is not suppportive of having you as a ruler. You should try to gain their support."
