### Fork & Clone

1. Fork the repository on GitLab to your own account.
2. Clone **your forked repository** to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <your-fork-ssh-or-https-url>
```

3. Navigate to the cloned directory:

```bash
cd <your-project-folder>
```

---

### Import Project in IntelliJ

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Select `File` > `Open...`.
3. Navigate to the folder where you cloned the repository (project root).
4. Click `OK` to open the project.
5. IntelliJ should detect the `pom.xml` file and import the Maven project automatically.
6. Set **Project SDK** to Java 11 or higher if not set automatically.

### Setup Git & SSH

* Generate a new SSH key if you don't have one:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "<your-email-or-comment>"
```

* Add your SSH public key to your GitLab account.
* Configure your Git identity:

```bash
git config --global user.name "user"
git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
```

### Build Project

From the root of the project directory, run:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

This will compile the project and package all necessary files.

### Run Project

Run the server/client using the Maven exec plugin:

### Troubleshooting

* **Java version mismatch**: Ensure `java -version` returns **11** or higher.
