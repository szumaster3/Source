So you've decided to help 'Wizard' Vief?
Welcome to the green team, the place for intelligent individuals.
The portal will open any moment. Are you ready?
I'm ready!
Good, preparation is the key to success. Keep those yellow orbs away.
No. What am I supposed to do?

I knew you were an intelligent lad. Here are your wands. When each team has enough people, Wizard Elriss will open the portal and you can get started. While we wait, shall I tell you what you need to do?

You already told me what to do.
I know that! I'm not senile, you know. Repetition is good for understanding. Tell me what you know, Mr Smarty Pants.
Errr, green orbs good, yellow orbs bad.
You won't be winning any awards for verbosity, but you got the gist of it.

Wizard Vief told me what to do.
That two-bit hack? That boy will quote you all kinds of algorithms and equations that other people have discovered. He's done nothing to forward the science of Runecrafting. I'll bet he told you to put yellow orbs into the altar.
Is that wrong?
It's completely wrong. He's misinterpreted Wizard Hallam's discoveries about the elemental rune energy signature. That mane was as crazy as Wizard Korvak over there. He really should have been reading the discoveries of Wizard Fowl in the interpretation of dimensional energy. At any rate, the yellow orbs contain a centre of energy that is harmful to run altars. They must be kept away. Green orbs must be put back to counteract the triangulated force of dimensional weight opposed against.

- That portal is serving a different game. You should wait for your portal.
- You enter the portal.
- If you were wearing your explorer's ring you may have earned more runes.
- The green orbs have stopped responding to yellow wands.
- You cannot create a barrier this close to the altar.
- You wand needs time to charge before creating another barrier. The barrier will be added shortly.
- You remove the barrier.

[MESSAGES]
Wizard Vief gives you 750 tokens. [perfect strike]
- "for loosers lolipop" XDD

[OPTION OR DIALOGUE?]
